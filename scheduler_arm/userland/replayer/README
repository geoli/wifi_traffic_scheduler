********Eclipse use, optional*******************
You can open that project as new project from existing code on Eclipse, 
File > New > Project > Android Project from Existing Code and press Next. 

Keep in mind that you must browse to the project root directory, for the
new Project to be setup correctly.


*******************Compile***********************
The Android.mk file describes the source files and their dependencies to the Android custom build system.

1) Make sure that you have placed the native_libpcap (available at the parent directory) under  <NDK_MODULE_PATH>/sources/android/

2) Move to the project root directory and run 'ndk-build' to build the source code and link against the static libpcap library, provided that the path to the ndk-build executable is set in your PATH (otherwise specify the path to the ndk-build executable). After that, the build should be successful and the executables should be placed under <ProjectRootDir>/libs/armeabi/
